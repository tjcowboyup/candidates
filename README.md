# candidates
Warmup
Take some time to get acquainted with the code

List out the ruby files that are loaded (required) when we run ruby main.rb
What does the pp method do? How is it different from puts (try it out!)?
Why is ActiveSupport being used (what happens if we take it out)?
Task 1 - Practice with Pry
Uncomment the binding.pry call in main.rb and run the main.rb code.

Try checking what the variable @candidates evaluates to. Tip: since the output will be longer than what can fit on the terminal, it will le t you use arrow keys or space bar to go down.

Task 2 - Experienced Candidates
Define a method experienced? that:

Takes in a candidate (hash)
Returns true if the candidate has 2 years of experience or more
Returns false otherwise
Task 3 - Finding by :id
Define a method find that:

Takes in an id
Returns the candidate with that :id
If there is no candidate with that id, it naturally returns nil
Task 4 - "Qualified" Candidates
Define a method qualified_candidates that:

Takes in the collection of candidates
Returns a subset of the candidates that meet the following criteria:
Are experienced
Have 100 or more Github points
Know at least Ruby or Python
Applied in the last 15 days
Are over the age of 17 (18+)
Tip: Consider creating other methods to help keep this one clean

Task 5 - Sort on Experience and Points
Define a method ordered_by_qualifications that:

Takes in a collection of candidates
Instead of filtering on the candidates, returns them all back but reordered such that:
Candidates with the most experience are at the top
For Candidates that have the same years of experience, they are further sorted by their number of Github points (highest first)
Task 6 - REPL-based Menu
Create a REPL that presents the user with a menu where they can type in one of the following commands:

find 1: This will display candidate with id 1
all: This will print them all out to the screen (one per line)
qualified: This will print only qualified candidates, ordered by experience and points (one per line)
quit: Exit the REPL / program
Bonus: When printing out candidates, colour the output based on their qualification (green for qualified, red for unqualified)
